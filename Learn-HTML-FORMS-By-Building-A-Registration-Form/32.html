Step 32
Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?

Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and nest an input accepting a file upload.

Sol:-

<fieldset>
         <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file"/></label>
</fieldset>

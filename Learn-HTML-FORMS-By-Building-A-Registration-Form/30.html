You need to confirm that the user has read the terms and conditions.

Add a label element. Inside the newly created label element add an input element and set the type attribute to checkbox. Make this input element required so users can not sign up without agreeing to the terms and conditions.

<label for="terms-and-conditions"><input type="checkbox" id="terms-and-conditions"required/></label>

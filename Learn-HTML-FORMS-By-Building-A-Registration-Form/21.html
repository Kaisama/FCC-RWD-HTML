Step 21
At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.

To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.

Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message.

Sol:-

<fieldset>
        <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" type="text" required/></label>
        <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" type="text" required/></label>
        <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" type="email" required/></label>
        <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" required/></label>
</fieldset>

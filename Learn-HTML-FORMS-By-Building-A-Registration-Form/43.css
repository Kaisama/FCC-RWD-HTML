Step 43
The HTML for the registration form is finished. Now, you can spruce it up a bit.

Start by changing the font to Tahoma, and the font size to 16px in the body.

Sol:-

body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
  color: #f5f6f7;
  font-family:Tahoma;
  font-size:16px;

}

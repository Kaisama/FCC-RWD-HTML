Step 27
You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.

To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time.

Sol:-

<fieldset>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type"/> Personal</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type"/> Business</label>
      </fieldset>

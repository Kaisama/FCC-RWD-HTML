Step 57
To style the submit button, you can use an attribute selector, which selects an element based on the given attribute value. Here is an example:

input[name="password"]
The above selects input elements with a name attribute value of password.

Now, use the attribute selector to style the submit button with a display of block, and a width of 60%.

Sol:-

input[type="submit"]{
  display:block;
  width:60%;
}

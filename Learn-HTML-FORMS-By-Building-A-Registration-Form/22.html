Step 22
Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.

Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.

Sol:-
 <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" minlength="8" required /></label>
